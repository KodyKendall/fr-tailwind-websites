older people fall out of the way out of the bathtub - major cause of death. the solution: "grab bars" So on his job that he is just barely finishing, he has no ledge, 
removed the tub, he reinforced the wall and put a grab bar there, and added two grab bars. 20 inch on that side. There will be another grab bar 
for when he's on the toilet.

Reinforce the walls for grab bars, he usually charged $250 for grab bar to install. BUT, he had to re-enforce the walls to have a really solid grab bar, 
so that it's not just put right into the tile. This is an example of how 2-tile doesn't cut corners: often, other remodelers will use anchors that are not solid.

But Alex 2-Tile does demo and redoes the framing in order to reinforce the grab bars to make sure that the owner didn't fall. 

That's the type of work that he does -- he doesn't want to cut corners, and he didn't even charge for the extra effort. Because he wants his customer
to have safe.

A lot of other remodelers wouldn't have moved the light switch, installed a bath fan, or reinforced the walls. But we go the extra distance.
